# Housing_prices
This project focuses on housing price data, creating an efficient dataset using data science techniques, and then building a linear regression model to accurately predict housing prices.

* To efficiently prepare the data, we have used data science techniques such as **data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier detection, one-hot encoding, and dimensionality reduction.** This preparation ensures the dataset is ready for accurate analysis and model building.
* Built a **linear regression model** to predict housing prices using the training data. Additionally, we used **K-Fold Cross-Validation** to measure the accuracy of the linear regression model.
